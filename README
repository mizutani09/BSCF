BSCF method
======================
//Kundan Kadam Apr 5 2016

Purpose:
   Creates a 2d rotating bipolytropic spheroid or torus. 
   This means that the star can have a core and envelope 
   with different polytropic indices and there can be a 
   molecular weight jump between the core-envelope boundary.
   
Input parameters (Specified in file runhydro.h):
1. Guesses for locations of points A, B and C.
   A(ax.ay) = equatorial boundary of rotating star/ outer edge of torus torus
   B(bx,by) = axial boundary of rotating star/ inner edge of torus torus
   C(ix, 2) = core/ envelope interface
   
2. np1 = polytropic index of the core
   np2 = polytropic index of the envelope
   mu1 = average molecular weight of the core
   mu2 = average molecular weight of the envelope

3. eps = convergance criterion
   numr = resolution in R-direction
   numz = resolution in z-direction

How to use:
1. Specify relevant parameters in file runhydro.h
2. >> make cl
   >> make
   >> ./scf
